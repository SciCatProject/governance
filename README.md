# Bluesky Governance

The purpose of this repository is to formalize the governance process that the
Bluesky project has used informally since its inception. This document
clarifies how decisions are made and how the various elements of our community
interact. It is adapted from
[GitHub's Minimum Viable Governance](https://github.blog/2021-07-22-minimum-viable-governance-lightweight-community-structure-foss-projects/).

## What's Changing?

In practice, very little.

Bluesky will continue to be developed in reponse to the needs of the staff and
users at institutions that use it. We are taking the process we have always
informally used, writing it down, and making a stronger attempt to follow it.

## Why?

More facilities are investing effort into Bluesky and projects that build upon
Bluesky. We want to communicate clearly how the project's direction is set and
how development is managed. We want to formalize and document the path future
Contributors can follow to become more active and influential in the project.

This document means to formalize that Bluesky is a multi-facility,
community-driven project.

## Status

These documents are in active development. They are being adapted from
[GitHub's Minimum Viable Governance](https://github.com/github/MVG).
We are in Step 2 of this process:

1. Develop draft at NSLS-II.
2. Collect input and/or buy-in from existing Collaborators via conversations,
   GitHub Issues on this repository, and the Nikea Slack.
3. Make any necessary modifications.
4. Sign.
