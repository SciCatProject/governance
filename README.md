# SciCat Project Governance

_IMPORTANT: these governance document are still a work-in-progress_

## Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to formalize the governance process that the SciCat project follows and has been using informally for the past few years. 
These documents clarify who has which responsibility, how decisions are made and how the various elements of our community interact. 
It is based from [Bluesky governance](https://), which has been adapted from
[GitHub's Minimum Viable Governance](https://github.blog/2021-07-22-minimum-viable-governance-lightweight-community-structure-foss-projects/).

## Why?

Data cataloging, curation and sharing are becoming a critical step in many facilities data lifecycle.
The SciCat project and its community aims to communicate clearly how the project is managed, how the priorities are set and effort is allocated. We would like to formalize and document the processes contributors and adopters can follow to become active members of the community and easily contribute to the project.
This effort is also important to communicate the commitment of the community to the Project and render SciCat a viable and well thought option in the landscape of data catalogues.

## Purpose
The governance documents aim to formalize the SciCat project (following referred as the Project) as an international, multi-facility, community-driven project.

## Governance Entities Mission
The Governance Entities of the Project are set in place to promote a positive development culture through caring for the entire community, strategic management, outreach, commitment to quality, effort on sustainability.

## Summary
Here is a short summary of the main actors and concepts used in the SciCat project.
_For more details, please see [CHARTER.md](./CHARTER.md)._

* __SciCat Core__ or __Core Components__.  
  SciCat core (Components) are the most essential services of SciCat and are identified in the __backend__ and __frontend__. They have separate repositories but are managed as a single entity.

* __Supported Projects__
  Additional projects (or components) providing essential services can be adopted by the SciCat community, become officially part of the SciCat project and be officially supported by the community. 
  Each supported project/component is granted its own repository under the SciCat project umbrella.
  Supported project may be orphaned, hence they do not have active Project Contributors. In such case, it is the job of the SciCat Steering Committee and Project Leaders to advocate for new Project Contributors or decide the fate of the Supported Project.  

* __Project Contributors__
  Each official project should have a written list of Project Contributors which are community members that manage and contribute the specific supported project. Each project has the ability to define the processes and workflow that works best for the supported project (e.g. how to review code, best practices, decision process and so forth). If no indication is provided by the project, the project will follow the same rules as applied to the SciCat core, listed below.


## Status

These documents are in active development. They have been adapted from
[Bluesky Governance](https://), which have been derived from the 
[GitHub's Minimum Viable Governance](https://github.com/github/MVG).
We are in Step 1 of the following process:

1. Develop a draft of the governance.
2. Collect feedback and contributions from Collaborators and the Community
   Please use GitHub Issues on this repository to provide feedback.
3. Content revision based on feedback.
4. Announce initial memberships for each group and committee and maintainers for each repo, if possible.  

Even if we are in step 1, we already working to find Project Leaders, and forming the Main Technical Committee.
