# SciCat Project Governance

_IMPORTANT: these governance document are still a work-in-progress_

## Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to formalize the governance process that the SciCat project follows and has been using informally for the past few years. 
These documents clarify who has which responsibility, how decisions are made and how the various elements of our community interact.  
It is based from [Bluesky governance](https://), which has been adapted from
[GitHub's Minimum Viable Governance](https://github.blog/2021-07-22-minimum-viable-governance-lightweight-community-structure-foss-projects/).

## Why?

Data cataloging, curation and sharing are becoming a critical step in many facilities data lifecycle. 
The SciCat project and its community aims to communicate clearly how the project is managed, how the priorities are set and effort is allocated. We would like to formalize and document the processes contributors and adopters can follow to become active members of the community and easily contribute to the project.
This effort is also important to communicate the commitment of the community to the Project and render SciCat a viable and well thought option in the landscape of data catalogues.

## Purpose
The governance documents aim to formalize the SciCat project (following referred as the Project) as an international, multi-facility, community-driven project.

## Adoption
Project contributors, adopting facilities and commercial partners agree to adhere to the definition, procedure and responsabilities described in the content of these documents

## Governance Entities Mission
The Governance Entities of the Project are set in place to promote a positive development culture through caring for the entire community, strategic management, outreach, commitment to quality, effort on sustainability.

## Status

These documents are in active development. They have been adapted from:  
- [Bluesky Governance](https://), which have been derived from the  
- [GitHub's Minimum Viable Governance](https://github.com/github/MVG).  
We are in Step 2 of the following process:

1. Develop a draft of the governance.
2. Collect feedback and contributions from Collaborators and the Community
   Please use GitHub Issues and PRs on this repository to provide feedback anc contributions.
3. Content revision based on feedback.
4. Announce initial memberships for each group and committee and maintainers for each repo, if possible.  

Even if we are in step 2, we already working to find Project Leaders, and forming the Main Technical Committee.
