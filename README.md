# SciCat Project Governance

_IMPORTANT: these governance document are still a work-in-progress_

The purpose of this repository is to formalize the governance process that the SciCat project follows and partially has been using informally for few years. 
This document clarifies how decisions are made and how the various elements of our community interact. 
It is based and derived from [Bluesky governance](https://), which has been adapted from
[GitHub's Minimum Viable Governance](https://github.blog/2021-07-22-minimum-viable-governance-lightweight-community-structure-foss-projects/).

## Why?

Data cataloging, curation and sharing are becoming a critical step of many facilities data lifecycle.
The SciCat project and its community want to communicate clearly how the project and its development is managed, how the priorities are set and effort is allocated.  
We want to formalize and document the path future
Contributors and adopters can follow to become active members and easily contribute to the project.

This document means to formalize that SciCat is an international, multi-facility, community-driven project.

## Summary
Here is a short summary of the main actors and concepts of the SciCat project.
_For more details, please see [CHARTER.md](./CHARTER.md)._

* __SciCat Core__.  
  The core services of SciCat are the __backend__ and __frontend__. They have separate repostiories but are managed as a single entity.
  Core Contributors are contributors and maintainers that actively contribute to one or both services.
  Core Contributors are listed in the matching repositories and also in the governance documents under SciCat Core Contributors.  

* __Supported Projects__
  Additional projects providing essential services can be adopted by the SciCat community and officially supported. 
  Each supported project has its own repository under the SciCat project umbrella and should have a written list of Project Contributors which are Contributors and Maintainers who manage contributions to the project repository. 
  The Maintainers have the ability to define the process that works best for the supported project (e.g. how to review code, best practices).
  The Maintainers operate by
  [consensus](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-resnick-on-consensus-01.html).
  If they are unable to reach consensus, they must escalate to the SciCat Main Technical Committee. They _don't_ resolve conflicts by vote.
  Supported project may be orphaned, hence they do not have active Project Contributors. In such case, it is the job of the SciCat Main Technical Committee and Project Leaders to advocate for new Project Contributors or decide the fate of the Supported Project.  

* __SciCat Main Technical Committee__
  This committee is composed of experienced Contributors with specific technical knowledge about SciCat backend and frontend, but also its entire ecosystem.  
  It should have an odd number of members.  
  It attempts to resolve questions by consensus, but if consensus fails they can vote.
  Members of the SciCat Main Technical Committee can also belong to the SciCat Core Contributors group or be contributors of any supported project.  

* __Project Leaders__
  The Project Leaders are three experienced Contributors. There is one _Project Leader_ and two _Deputy Leaders_.  
  Their responsability are:
  - to promote the project,
  - maintain relationships with all collaborators
  - provide guidance
  - step-in in case of disputes
  - maintain relationship with adopting facilities and their management  
  This roles are time limited. When one of the three positions is up for reneweal, elections will be held between the members of SciCat Core and SciCat Main Technical Committee to find a replacement.  

* __Users Groups__
  Everybody is welcome and invited to join a users group and provide valuable feedback on SciCat project. Each user group shoul dhave a spokes person that reports back to the Main Technical Committee and the Project Leaders.  
  The feedback from such meetings will be distilled and passed to the SciCat Main Technical Comnmittee for evaluation to steer the project to address users needs and efficiently allocate available effort.

## Status

These documents are in active development. They have been adapted from
[Bluesky Governance](https://), which have been derived from the 
[GitHub's Minimum Viable Governance](https://github.com/github/MVG).
We are in Step 1 of the following process:

1. Develop a draft of the governance.
2. Collect feedback and contributions from Collaborators and the Community
   Please use GitHub Issues on this repository to provide feedback.
3. Content revision based on feedback.
4. Announce initial memberships for each group and committee and maintainers for each repo, if possible.  

Even if we are in step 1, we already working to find Project Leaders, and forming the Main Technical Committee.
