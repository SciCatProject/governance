# SciCat Project Governance

The purpose of this repository is to formalize the governance process that the
SciCat project follows and partially has been using informally for few years. 
This document clarifies how decisions are made and how the various elements of our community
interact. 
It is based and dericed from [Bluesky governance](https://), which has been adapted from
[GitHub's Minimum Viable Governance](https://github.blog/2021-07-22-minimum-viable-governance-lightweight-community-structure-foss-projects/).

## Why?

Data cataloging, curation and sharing are becoming a critical step of many facilities data lifecycle.
The SciCat project want to communicate clearly how the project and its development is managed, 
and how the priorities are set and. We want to formalize and document the path future
Contributors and adopters can follow to become more active and influential in the project.

This document means to formalize that SciCat is an international, multi-facility,
community-driven project.

## Summary

_For details, start with [CHARTER.md](./CHARTER.md)._

* __SciCat Core__.  
  The core services of SciCat are the backend and frontend. They are managed as a single entity.
  Core Contributors are contributors and maintainers that actively contribute to one or both services.
  Core Contributors are listed in the matching repositories and also in the governance documents under SciCat Core Contributors.
* __Supported Projects__
  Additional projects providing essential services can be adopted by the SciCat community and officially supported. 
  Each supported project has its own repository under the SciCat project umbrella and should have a written list of Project Contributors which are Contributors and Maintainers who manage contributions to the project repository. 
  The Maintainers have lattitude to define the process that works best for supported project (e.g. how much code review).
  The Maintainers operate by
  [consensus](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-resnick-on-consensus-01.html).
  If they are unable to reach consensus, they must escalate to the SciCat Main Technical Committee. They _don't_ resolve conflicts by vote.
  Supported project may be orphaned, hence they do not have Project Contributors. In such case, it is the job of the SciCat Main Technical Committee to advocate for new Project Contributors or decide the fate of the Supported Project.
* __SciCat Main Technical Committee__
  This committee is composed of experienced Contributors with specific technical knowledge about SciCat. 
  It should have an odd number of members.
  It attempts to resolve questions by consensus, but if consensus fails they can vote.
  Members of the SciCat Main Technical Committee can also belong to the SciCat Core Contributors group.
* __Project Leaders__
  The Project Leaders is composed by three experienced Contributors. It has the _Project Leader_ and two _Deputy Leaders_. 
  Their responsability are:
  - to promote the project,
  - maintain relationships with collaborators
  - provide guidance
  - step-in in case of disputes
  - maintain relationship with adopting facilities and their management
  This roles are time limited. When one of the three positions is up for reneweal, elections will be held between the members of SciCat Core and SciCat Main Technical Committee.
* __Users Groups__
  Everybody is welcome and invited to join a users group and provide valuable feedback on SciCat project.
  The feedback from such meetings will be distilled and passed to the SciCat Main Technical Comnmittee for evaluation to steer the project to address users needs and efficiently allocate available effort.

## Status

These documents are in active development. They have been adapted from
[Bluesky Governance](https://), which have been derived from the 
[GitHub's Minimum Viable Governance](https://github.com/github/MVG).
We are in Step 1 of the following process:

1. Develop a draft of the governance.
2. Collect feedback and contributions from Collaborators and the Community
   Please use GitHub Issues on this repository to provide feedback.
3. Content revision based on feedback.
4. Announce initial memberships for each group and committee and maintainers for each repo, if possible.
