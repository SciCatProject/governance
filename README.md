# Bluesky Governance

These documents articulate the governance of the Bluesky Project open-source
collaboration.

## What's Changing?

In practice, very little. Bluesky will continue to be developed in reponse to
the needs of the staff and users at institutions that adopt it. We are taking
the process we have always informally used, writing it down, and making a
stronger attempt to follow it. We are setting a clearer path for future
Contributors to follow to become more active and influential in the project.

## Why?

More facilities are investing effort into Bluesky and projects that build upon
Bluesky. We want to communicate clearly how the project's direction is set and
how development is managed.

## Status

These documents are in active development. They are being adapted from
[GitHub's Minimum Viable Governance](https://github.com/github/MVG).
We are in Step 1 of this process:

1. Develop draft at NSLS-II (target completion date November 15).
2. Collect input and/or buy-in from existing Collaborators.
3. Make an necessary modifications.
4. Sign.
