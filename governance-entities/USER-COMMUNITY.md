# Users community

## Description
We consider a user any person who uses, interact, and/or works with SciCat.  
The _user community_ is the entity encompassing all the users.

## Membership
There are no barriers to become member of the users group and actively participate to users group meetings.

## Responsibilities
The users group does not have any assigned responsibilities nor duties, although its members are encouraged, welcome and, at times, asked to provide feedback and opinions on specific topic.  
They are instrumental in guiding the project vision and effort allocation.

## Meetings
Once or twice a year a townhall meeting dedicated to the user community will be organized by the Project.
The objectives are to facilitate the communication between the leadership and the users community, specifically important topics are:
- improve SciCat as a whole, 
- improve user experience, 
- dissseminate relevant knowledge, 
- collect and distil feedback on usability and future features. 
Dates and location of the user meeting will advertise through the Project channels

### Local meetings
Users are encouraged to organize local meetings in their home institution, geographic area, or science domain. The general objectives of local meetings are to discuss any topic related to the Project in a smaller and more focused setting.

## User Feedback
User feedback should be provide through the official channels: 
- slack posts, 
- github issues, 
- emails to the interested parties, 
- direct contact with contributors.

Users can participate to the contributors meetings upon request. They are highly encouraged to inform the meeting organizers if they want any specific topic on the agenda. They should respect the meeting agenda.
