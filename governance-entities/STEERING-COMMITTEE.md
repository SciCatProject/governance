## Abbreviations and Links

## Description
The Steering Committee includes representatives of supporting facilities.
Members of the Steering Committee should not be Project Contributors, but should be part of the management team of the facilities or consortiuum they are part of.

## Responsibilities and Duties
The SC is tasked with:
- providing guidance and non-binding feedback to the Project Leaders (PL), 
- promoting the Project within their home facilties and science community
- promoting the Project at large
- help sustaining the project
- discover possible funding sources
- make sure that their facility allocates resources to sustain the project
- monitor, confirm and support fair election of candidates for Project Leaders and Technical Leaders positions.  

## Meeting
The SC should meet at least once a year, possibly in person and at the annual meeting SciCatCon.
The meeting will be scheduled and announced in due time through the Project official channels.
Aside of the single annual meeting, additional meetings might be organized based on the Project needs. Additional meetings can happen on-line.

## Eligibility
A person is eligible to become a member of the SC if and only if their home facility is able to allocate at least a half FT, or an equivalent effort, to sustain the Project.  

## Representation
Each supporting facility is granted a number of votes equivalent to the number of half FTs that is able to dedicate to the Project.
The number of votes are distributed among the members representing the facility. The maximum number of facility members is equal to the number of half FTs allocated by the facility.

## Posting Duration
Memberships in the SC are not time bounded.  
The list of the supporting facility and their effort will be updated once year. We will strive to generate the updated list at the in-person meeting, although it will not be guaranteed it. The new efforts will guide the adjustment to members of the SC.
The participating facility has the responsibility to manage its membership to the SC and nominate a new member if a current one is stepping down. If no new member is nominated, the supporting facility will relinquish their representation and voting power.

## Resignation
A member of the Steering Committee can resign at any time.  
A resigning member should inform the Project members (the SC, the PL and TL) with a written communication posted in the official project channels.

## Effort evaluation
During the yearly meeting, each contributing facility is required to state the effort allocated for the following year, so representation in the SC can be adjusted.
