# Supported Projects

__Support Projects__ are all the projects note beloging to SciCat Core, providing essential services which have been adopted by the SciCat community.  
Such projects become officially part of the SciCat project and are therefore officially supported by the community.  
Each supported project is granted its own repository under the SciCat project umbrella. They have to follow the code of conduct of the SciCat Project, although they are encouraged to manage their leadership on their own.
Supported projects may be orphaned, meaning they do have no project leadership and/or contributors. In such case, it is responsability of the SciCat Steering Committee and SciCat Project Leaders to step in, temporarily lead the project and advocate for new leadership and/or contributors. They can also decide to end Supported Project and archive the repository.
