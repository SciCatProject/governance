## Description
__Support Projects__ are all the projects adopted by the SciCat community and having a repository on the github Project page, but outside the [SciCat Core](./SCICAT-CORE.md).  

## Governance
SP are officially covered under and have to adire to the Project governance described in these documents.  
They also have to follow the [code of conduct](../other/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md) included in the Project geovernance.

## Resources and Support
Each SP is granted its own repository under the SciCat project umbrella and supported by the Project community.  
SP are encouraged to manage their leadership on their own, although following the rules described under the TL section. They might request direct involvement of and seek advice from the PL and the SC.  
SP may be orphaned, meaning they do have no project leadership and/or contributors. In such case, it is responsability of the PL and the SC to step in, temporarily lead the project and advocate for new leadership and/or contributors. They can also decide to end the SP and archive the repository.  

## Process
A project linked to SciCat can become an SP by following the procedure described under the [supported Project Request](../procedures/SUPPORTED_PROJECT_REQUEST.md) section.
