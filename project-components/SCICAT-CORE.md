# SciCat Core

SciCat Core, also referred to as SciCat Core Components, are the most essential services of the SciCat Data Catalogue. They are the __backend__ and __frontend__.   
They are maintained in two separate repositories but are managed as a single entity and always tested together extensively.  
The SciCat Core is the primary focus of __Project Leaders__ (PL) and __Steering Committee__ (SC).
