## Abbreviation
SC = Steering Committee
FT = Full Time

## Description
The Steering Committee includes representatives of adopting and supporting facilities.
Members of the Steering Committee should not be Project Contributors, but should be part of the management team of the facilities or consortiuum they are part.

## Responsibilities and Duties
The Steering Committee is tasked with:
- providing guidance and non-binding feedback to the Project Leaders, 
- promoting the Project within their home facilties and science community
- promoting the Project at large
- help sustaining the project
- discover possible founding sources
- make sure that their facility allocates resources to sustain the project

## Meeting
The Steering Committee should meet at least once a year, possibly in person and at the annual meeting SciCatCon.
The meeting will be scheduled and announced in due time through the Project official channels.
Aside of the single annual meeting, additional meetings might be organized based on the Project needs. Additional meetings can happen on-line.

## Eligibility
A person is eligible to become a member of the SC if and only if their home facility is able to allocate at least a half FT, or an equivalent effort, to sustain the Project.  

## Representation

The number of votes are distributed among the members representing the facility. The maximum number of facility members is equal to the number of half FTs allocated by the facility.

## Posting Duration
Memberships in the Steering Committee are not time bounded.
The participating facility has the responsibility to manage its membership to the Steering Committee.

## Resignation

## Effort evaluation
During the yearly meeting, each contributing facility is required to state the effort allocated for the following year, so representation in the Steering Committee can be adjusted.
