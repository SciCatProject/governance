it is not required for consensus. Rather, the Governing Body will determine consensus 
based on their good faith consideration of a number of factors, 
including the dominant view of the Governing Body and nature of support and objections. 
(The Internet Engineering Task Force, which operates on this principle, has published a 
useful document with examples, ["On Consensus and Humming in the IETF"](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-resnick-on-consensus-01.html).) 
The Governing Body will document evidence of consensus in accordance with these requirements. 
If consensus cannot be reached, the Governing Body will make the decision by vote.

the Governing Body, setting out a discussion period and a separate voting period.

The discussion will be open to the public. In any vote, each voting representative will have one vote. 
Except as specifically noted elsewhere in this Charter, decisions by vote require a simple majority vote of all voting members.
The PL will be the guaranteers of the vote.
