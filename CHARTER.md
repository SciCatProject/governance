## 5. Voting

### 5.1. Decision Making
The PAB and the TSC follow the same decision-making process. 
The Board or Committee, respectively, (the "Governing Body") will strive for all 
decisions to be made by consensus. 
While explicit agreement of the entire Governing Body is preferred, 
it is not required for consensus. Rather, the Governing Body will determine consensus 
based on their good faith consideration of a number of factors, 
including the dominant view of the Governing Body and nature of support and objections. 
(The Internet Engineering Task Force, which operates on this principle, has published a 
useful document with examples, ["On Consensus and Humming in the IETF"](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-resnick-on-consensus-01.html).) 
The Governing Body will document evidence of consensus in accordance with these requirements. 
If consensus cannot be reached, the Governing Body will make the decision by vote.

### 5.2. Voting
The Governing Body's Chair together with PL will call a vote with reasonable notice to 
the Governing Body, setting out a discussion period and a separate voting period. 
Any discussion may be conducted in person or electronically by text, voice, or video. 
The discussion will be open to the public. In any vote, each voting representative will have one vote. 
Except as specifically noted elsewhere in this Charter, decisions by vote require a simple majority vote of all voting members.
The PL will be the guaranteers of the vote.

## 6. Termination of Membership

In addition to the method set out in sections 2.2 and 3.2, the membership of any Governing Body member will terminate if any of the following occur:

### 6.1 Resignation
Written notice of resignation to the Governing Body the person is member of with at least 1 month notice. 
In case of a PL resignation, the resignation should be sent with 3 months notice and also advertised in TSC and all the PAB members should be informed.

### 6.2 Unreachable Member
If a member is unresponsive at its listed handle for more than three months,
the Governing Body may vote to remove the member.
