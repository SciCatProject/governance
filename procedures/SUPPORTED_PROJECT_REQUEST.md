# Supported Project Request

Any project developed within the SciCat ecosystem or interacting in any shape or form with the SciCat Project are eligible to present the request to become a Supported Project.

The Supported Project Request can be submitted via the official channels to the Project Leaders and must contains the following components:
- a public repository containing the code base
- a public official working release
- documentation highlighting how to install, configure and run the application, if project provides an application
- a compelling reason for acquiring the status of the Supported Project
- a project technical leader
- a group of supporting members, if possible

The Project Leaders will present the case the Contributing Members and, if needed, to the Steering Committee, and call a vote. If the request obtains the majority of the vote, it will acquire the status of Supported Project. 
This will grant a repo in the SciCat project on GitHub, together with visibility on the Project website and space for its documentation together with the official SciCat documentation.
