## Eligibility
Any project developed within the SciCat ecosystem or interacting in any shape or form with the Project is eligible to present the request to become a Supported Project (SP).

## Request
The Supported Project Request can be submitted via the official Project Channels to the Project Leaders and must contains the following information:
- a public repository containing the code base
- a public official working release
- documentation highlighting how to install, configure and run the application, if project provides an application
- a compelling reason for acquiring the status of the Supported Project
- a project technical leader
- a group of supporting members, if possible
- current license the code is released under

## Procedure
The Project Leaders will make sure to present the case to the relevant stakeholders (Collaborators, Steering Committee, Users community) to the best suitable way given time and opportunities constraints. The project Leaders should schedule a vote, leaving enough time for an open discussion.

## Results
The candidate project will acquire the status of Supported Project, if the request obtains the majority of the votes.
