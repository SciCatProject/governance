# Nomination

Any Project Contributor is eligible to be nominated to become a Project Leader or a Technical Leader, proven that he/she has a solid knowledge of the Project. He/she might be asked to sustain an interview with any of the Project governing entities. The interviews will be decided by the current PLs on per-nomination case.

The nomination for a Project Leader position can happen in any of the following ways:
- a project member volunteer is name for an open position and receives support from at least three other project members
- a group of at least three project members propose a specific project member for an open position

No matter, how many nominations/candidate are present for a single position, a vote will be called and the candidate with the most votes will be offered the position.
