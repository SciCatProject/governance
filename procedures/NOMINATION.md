## Description
Any Project AC meeting the eligibility criteria for the position can be nominated to the open position.   
He/she might be asked to sustain one or more interviews with or make a presentations to any of the Project governance entities. The course of action will be decided by the current PLs on per-nomination and per-position case.
The eligibility criteria are described in the governance document of the related entity.

Nominations for an open position may be submitted through either of the following methods:   
- A project member may put themselves forward as a candidate, provided that they have the backing of at least three other project members.  
- Alternatively, a group of at least three project members may nominate a fellow project member for the open position.

Each nomination must be supported by at least three Project AC. It should be communicated to the PL and, possibly, announced publicly through the official PC together with the associated voting information.
     
## Important
No matter, how many nominations/candidates are present for a single position, a vote will be called and the candidate with the most votes will be offered the position.
