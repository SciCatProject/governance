# Repo Archival

In a case a Supported Project or a Core Component becomes obsolete or unsupported for more than 6 months, 
The Project Leaders are allowed to propose any project for archival if a valid reason is present, which can be one or many, but not limited to, one of the following:
- the project has become obsolete
- the project is not used
- the project is lacking support

The proposed archival should be announced publicly through the official channels. A period of discussion should follow and than the vote should take place. If voting express positive support, the project and the connected repo should be archived.
The process should be documented.
