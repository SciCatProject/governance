## Description
Core repositories follows the procedure indicated below for contributions.

Other SciCat repositories (Supported Projects and Non-Code repositories) are highly encouraged to follow the same procedure. If they decide otherwise, they should clearly state the contribution procedure in the CONTRIBUTING.md files included in the root folder of the repository. 
Each repository should also indicate who are the maintainers of the repository and list them, together with their responsibility, in the MAINTAINERS.md file.

## SciCat Contributing Workflow 
* Latest version of the project code should be contained in a branch named _master_ or _main_.  
* Main branch _master_ or _main_ should be protected and can not be directly modified.
* Any work-in-progress on the code, including but not limited to new features, bug fixing and non-code changes, should be conducted in a dedicated branch or a fork with read and write access for the maintainers.  
* Every requested change should go through a Pull Request from the dedicated branch to the _master_ or _main_ branch of the project repo.
* The person submitting a Pull Request should not merge their own Pull Request.
* Pull requests review should be solicited among the list of official project reviewers and the community as a whole.
* Pull requests with large impact should be reviewed by at least 2 maintainers, one of which should be from a different institution or group.
* The review period for pull requests with large impact is minimum a week and maximum 2 weeks.
* Pull requests with lower impact can be reviewed by at least 1 maintainer.
* The review period for pull requests with lower impact is maximum 2 weeks.
* It is the responsibility of submitter and the maintainers to indicate the impact of the pull request. 
* The impact can be changed after the initial submission, granted that a valid justification is provided and publicly documented.
* The pull requests should be approved and pass all the CI tests before can be merged.
* Only maintainers with the assigned role of pull request masters can merge approved pull requests.
* the related branch should be deleted when the pull request is merged or closed.
