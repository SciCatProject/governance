## Description
At any time, a group of at least three Project AC can present the request for a member dismissal given a valid reason. Accepted valid reasons are: 
- the member has been disruptive to the project, 
- the member has been disrespectful to other Project members or any stakeholder
- the member has been in clear violation of the code of conduct.

The request should be submitted to the PL, which will trigger the early dismissal protocol.  
If the PL wrongly decide to not take any action, the request might brought the attention of the SC.

In the extreme case of harrasment, the victim can reach out directly any PL or the SC, which has the duty to start the early dismissal protocol and manage in sansible way the initial communication.


## Protocol
Once the protocol is active, the subject of the protocol, should put on hold all of his/her duties. The PL and, if needed, the SC will hear all the parties involved.   
If a reasonable agreement can be reached between the parties involved, the PL will document such agreement and make sure that the agreement is enforce and followed through.  
If no reasonable agreement can be reached, the situation is escalated and a vote on the matter will be called. The vote will decide the early dismissal of the member subject of the protocol.  
The whole process should be documented for fairness and later review. In case of harrassment, the identity of the victim should be protected and revealed only with the victim's agreement
