 - the available options, if applicable, 
 - date and location when the voting will take place
 - who is eligible to vote, aka the voting body. If changes to the voting body are required, such changes should be clearly documented, as described in the [voting body](../governance-entities/VOTING-BODY.md) section.

## Discussion
A discussion period should preceed time of the voting. Any discussion may be conducted in person or electronically by text, voice, or video. The discussion will be open to the public and should be accessible through the official PC.

## Decision Making
When a voting is requested and scheduled, although the Project strive to reach a consensus, the outcome will always be decided by majority of the voting body. 
If a proper outcome cannot be reached at the time of the Voting, the PL have the authority to reschedule the voting or take upon themselves to selected the outcome based on their good faith consideration of a number of factors, including the dominant view of the all the stakeholders and nature of support and objections. 
If a decision cannot be reached at all, the PL will seek out the guidance of the SC.

## Vote
In any voting, each member of the VB will have one vote, and all the votes are equal.

## Responsibilities
It is the duty of the PL to call a vote on the matter at hand with reasonable notice and inform all the interested parties, better if the whole project, and, specifically, the project members eligible to vote.
The PL will be the guaranteers of the vote. They also have the duty to document and report the results back to the community.

## Results
